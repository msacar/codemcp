This is a detailed summary of the conversation, which outlines an AI agent's process of understanding and explaining the codemcp project.

The conversation follows an AI agent as it explores a local project folder (/Users/mustafaacar/codemcp) to understand its purpose and functionality in response to user queries.

Initial Exploration: What is codemcp?

The agent began by listing the project's files to get an overview. It identified the project as a Python application named codemcp.

Reading the README.md: The agent discovered that codemcp is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that turns the Claude AI into a pair programming assistant. It allows Claude to directly edit files, run tests, and refactor code on a user's local machine, eliminating the need to copy-paste code.

Key Design Principles:

Claude Pro Integration: Designed to work with a subscription, avoiding per-action costs.

Auto-Accept by Default: The agent works autonomously without needing constant user approval for each step.

IDE Agnostic: It is not tied to a specific editor like VSCode.

Security: It uses a restricted shell, only allowing commands pre-approved in a codemcp.toml configuration file.

Git Versioning: All AI-driven edits are automatically committed to Git for easy review and rollback.

Architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md): The agent further learned that the project is configured via a codemcp.toml file, which defines custom commands (like format, test) and a project_prompt to give Claude project-specific instructions. It exposes several tools to Claude, including ReadFile, WriteFile, EditFile, ls, and grep.

Command-Specific Questions

The user then asked about specific commands and functionalities.

What does the think command do?

The agent investigated the codemcp/tools/think.py file.

Functionality: The think command is a simple logging tool. It does not modify any files or fetch new information. Its sole purpose is to log a "thought" from Claude into the log file (~/.codemcp/codemcp.log).

Purpose: It acts as a "scratchpad" or "working memory" for Claude. The AI uses it during complex tasks to record its plan, track progress, document hypotheses while debugging, or maintain context across multiple tool calls.

How to run the project using uv?

The agent synthesized information from the README.md, pyproject.toml, and contribution guides to provide a comprehensive answer.

Quick Start (from GitHub): The recommended method for users is uvx --from git+https://github.com/ezyang/codemcp@prod codemcp serve.

Local Development: For developers working on codemcp itself:

Clone the repository.

Create a virtual environment: uv venv

Activate it (see next section).

Install dependencies: uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

Run the server: python -m codemcp or codemcp serve

Fish Shell Activation Issue

When the user encountered an error trying to activate the virtual environment, the agent correctly identified the issue.

Problem: The user was using the fish shell, but the activation command source .venv/bin/activate is for bash/zsh.

Solution: The correct command for fish shell is source .venv/bin/activate.fish.

How to Improve codemcp

Finally, the user asked for suggestions on how to make the codemcp agent better for AI collaboration. The agent provided a detailed list of potential improvements, categorized for clarity.

Context & Navigation: Add tools for project overview (project_overview), code intelligence (find_definition, find_usages), and smarter file reading that excerpts relevant sections.

Error Handling & Testing: Provide more detailed context when commands fail and improve test integration with tools to check test coverage (test_coverage).

Git & Documentation: Enhance Git integration (git_context) and allow the AI to understand key documentation files like ARCHITECTURE.md.

Memory & Efficiency: Implement features for memory between sessions and improve token efficiency through techniques like lazy loading and smart truncation of files.

Advanced Features: Integrate with Language Servers for type info and autocompletion, and provide project templates for faster setup (codemcp init --template fastapi).
